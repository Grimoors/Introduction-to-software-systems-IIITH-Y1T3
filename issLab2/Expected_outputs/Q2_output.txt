hamlet.txt:To be, or not to be: that is the question:
hamlet.txt:That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
--
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
--
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
